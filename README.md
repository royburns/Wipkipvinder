De Wipkipvinder
===============

The 'wipkipvinder' is a handy dutch mobile website to find the nearest playground swings and such...

It was built as a quick demo prototype using open city data, in this case shape files used by the Rotterdam and The Hague municipality.
Shape files they ordinarily use to find broken stuff and fix it. The shape files were converted to JSON and then the result was wrapped in some jquery mobile to make a quick interface.

Have fun!
